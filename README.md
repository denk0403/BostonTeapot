## Boston Teapot (Final Project for CS 4300)

We created an animated scene of a textured teapot and mug. It is laid out on a single canvas using **ThreeJS**, and both meshes are sitting on a flat surface. We used a perspective projection camera, as well as implemented orbital and panning controls for viewing the scene from various angles using the mouse and keyboard.

There is directional lighting source pointing at the teapot and mug from above at a bit of an angle, as well as ambient lighting to increase the overall brightness of the scene. The rest of the scene is textured to include an image of a ground and indoor background.

Alongside the basic requirements, we added shadows casted from the teapot and mug onto the ground, as well as used bump maps to add a slight 3D illusion to the texture of the ground and the mug. Lastly, the animation of the teapot lifts it and rotates it above the mug as if it were pouring its contents, and then returns to its start position where it continues to loop.
